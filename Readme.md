# volascripts

To make scripts possible to install and use at all, you need to install either 
[tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
or [tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
In order to install a script, click on any link in the list above that ends with `*.user.js`,
it will take you to the page with script's source code. After that click on the `Raw` button
and confirm installation with your userscript extension.

## What those scripts do?

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/volafiled/volascripts/wiki) for description of some of the
scripts. Stuff's work in progress tho!
